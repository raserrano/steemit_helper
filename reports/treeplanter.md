#### NEW manual how to plan trees with me.
1. You, good lady or man, transfer between 0.01 and 1 STEEM/SBD to my wallet, with the link in memo of the post or comment you want to have upvoted by me (self-voting not allowed).
2. I will upvote the post and attempt to add 100% value per vote per STEEM/SBD you send, so 0.01 STEEM/SBD donation = approx 0.02 STEEM/SBD worth of vote, up to 1 STEEM/SBD = 1 STEEM/SBD worth of vote.

#### I will share your donations.
1. 50% of it is going directly to Cameroon to fund our conservation program to save Abongphen Highland Forest
2. 50% will help me to grow and get more STEEM POWER to share more happiness and money on Steemit to you Steemians. e.g. If you send me 1 STEEM/SBD (it is almost same) I will divide it and use half (0.5) for tree planting (you plant 0.5 tree) and the second half to power me up.
# EACH DOLLAR (sent to Cameroon) = 1 TREE PLANTED
## PLANT A TREE AND GET PAID FOR IT. BUT BE NICE AND SEND IT AS FREE UP VOTE GIFT TO SOMEBODY!

#### Help me to grow to be able to plant more trees daily and share more money back to you people.
Delegate SP to me - @treeplanter

#### My rules (1.Level – 7,500 SP):
1. Each post could be upvoted by me only once – if you send the same post again, your contribution is going to be considered as donation without upvoting
2. If you transfer less than 0.01 STEEM/SBD, I will just thank you for your donation – no upvoting
3. If you transfer more than 1 STEEM/SBD, I will upvote the post as the donation is 1 STEEM/SBD, the rest is just a donation – thank you for it.
4. I am going to keep my SP always high - meaning I will only vote every day to keep 80% of voting power. The amount of daily available votes depends on my current SP see above.
5. If my SP is exhausted you will be queued – your link will get my upvote immediately I am strong again.

Thanks following steemians for delegated power  |SP delegated
